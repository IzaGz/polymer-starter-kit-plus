## Getting Started

To take advantage of Polymer Starter Kit Plus you need to:

1. Get a copy of the code.
2. Install the dependencies if you don't already have them.
3. Modify the application to your liking.
4. Deploy your production code.

### Get the code

[Download](https://github.com/StartPolymer/polymer-starter-kit-plus/releases/latest) and extract Polymer Starter Kit Plus to where you want to work.

Or `git clone https://github.com/StartPolymer/polymer-starter-kit-plus.git <my-repo-name>`

### Updating from previous version

If you've previously downloaded a copy of the full Starter Kit and would like to update to the latest version, here's a git workflow for doing so:

```sh
git init
git checkout -b master
git add .
git commit -m 'Check-in 1.0.1'
git remote add upstream https://github.com/StartPolymer/polymer-starter-kit-plus.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
# resolve the merge conflicts in your editor
git add . -u
git commit -m 'Updated to 1.0.2'
```

### Install dependencies

#### Quick-start (for experienced users)

With Node.js installed, run the following one liner from the root of your Polymer Starter Kit Plus download:

```sh
npm install -g gulp bower && npm install && bower install
```

#### Prerequisites (for everyone)

The full starter kit requires the following major dependencies:

- Node.js, used to run JavaScript tools from the command line.
- npm, the node package manager, installed with Node.js and used to install Node.js packages.
- gulp, a Node.js-based build tool.
- bower, a Node.js-based package manager used to install front-end packages (like Polymer).

**To install dependencies:**

1)  Check your Node.js version.

```sh
node --version
```

The version should be at or above 0.12.x.

2)  If you don't have Node.js installed, or you have a lower version, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and click on the big green Install button.

3)  Install `gulp` and `bower` globally.

```sh
npm install -g gulp bower
```

This lets you run `gulp` and `bower` from the command line.

4)  Install the starter kit's local `npm` and `bower` dependencies.

```sh
cd polymer-starter-kit && npm install && bower install
```

This installs the element sets (Paper, Iron, Platinum) and tools the starter kit requires to build and serve apps.

### Development workflow

#### Serve / watch

```sh
gulp serve
```

This outputs an IP address you can use to locally test and another that can be used on devices connected to your network.

#### Run tests

```sh
gulp test:local
```

This runs the unit tests defined in the `app/test` directory through [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester).

#### Build & Vulcanize

```sh
gulp
```

Build and optimize the current project, ready for deployment. This includes linting as well as vulcanization, image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification.

## Service Worker

Polymer Starter Kit Plus offers an offline experience thanks to Service Worker and the [Platinum Service Worker elements](https://github.com/PolymerElements/platinum-sw). New to Service Worker? Read the following [introduction](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit#service-worker) to understand how it works.
